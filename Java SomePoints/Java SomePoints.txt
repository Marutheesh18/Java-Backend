1)Local Variables should be initialized , if we try to print its value in the block without initializing we will get an error
2)We cannot use non-static variable in static method 
  static --> non static --> Allowed
  non static --> static --> Not Allowed
  Static variables , methods gets memory at the time of class loading at first only
3)If any class will not extends any other class or it does not have any parent class means its default parent class will be "object"
4)Try will run if it has finally not catch after it but they should be in sequence ie try after catch or finally . 
  The sequence should be try->catch->finally . finally cannot come before catch .
  JVM creates an object of error and it throws at runtime , if main method also throws exception means , the exception is handled by the JVM itself
5)Private methods cannot be overridden 
  In  Overriding, the child class method should have more powerful or bigger usage access modifier than parent class method access modifier
  default(parent) -> protected(child)
  protected(parent) -> public(child)
6)For Abstract class , an object cannot be created , but it will have constructor because abstract class will have instance variables (constructor is used to assign default values to variables)
For Interface class , an object cannot be created and it wont have constructor because its variables are public , static , final . In final we assign the value when variable is declared itself so there wont be any need of constructor to assign default values.
